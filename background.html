		  <br><h1>Background</h1>
		  <p> Previous studies have begun the exploration of this research topic. In a cross-sectional study conducted through questionnaires in China, researchers found improvements in patients’ perceptions of the doctor-patient relationship (DPR) and increased trust in comparison to before the pandemic (Zhao et al., 2021).  Authors also identified factors that strain DPR—mainly cost and over-expectations of efficacy and doctor knowledge—and factors that improve DPR—improvements in medical technology, service, communication, and publicized medical knowledge. This study illustrates a correlation between patients’ perceptions of DPR and their trust in healthcare providers. However, its cross-sectional nature and questionnaire methods limit its ability to provide strong evidence for causation. Moreover, the study’s localization in China leaves unclear whether similar observations would be observed elsewhere.
			<br><br>In Spain, a phenomenological study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Hospital Clinic de Barcelona found that patients had “full confidence” in healthcare professionals; obstacles to DPR such as busy spaces and uncertainty were perceived as “inevitable” rather than negative (Venturas et al., 2021). The study also identified minimizing patients’ sense of isolation and allowing communication with family as key factors in satisfaction. Overall, the study illustrates a correlation between patients’ perceptions of DPR and their satisfaction in healthcare and suggests that patient satisfaction may be more lenient of obstacles to DPR in the current context. However, the results are limited to inpatients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Hospital Clinic de Barcelona and therefore may not apply to patients in other clinical settings or in other regions.
			<br><br>Other studies on the topic were also conducted in inpatient settings (Sarre et al., 2021), or were conducted in virtual telemedicine settings (Cliffe and Stevenson., 2021; Itamura et al., 2020), or were reiterative of the study conducted by Zhao et al. (Hu, Lingmin et al., 2021). Existing literature provides preliminary support for a positive correlation between patients’ perceptions of DPR and their trust and satisfaction in clinical settings during COVID-19. Potential influencing factors of each have also been identified. However, the existing literature leaves room for further exploration of the topic in other clinical settings and in other regions of the world, as differences in the expectations and cultural backgrounds of patients may lead to different results.
