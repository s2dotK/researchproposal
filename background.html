        <h1>Background
        </h1><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Cross-sectional study conducted through questionnaires in China found improvements in patients’ perception of the doctor-patient relationship (DPR) and increased trust as compared to before the pandemic (Zhao et al., 2021)</li>
          <ul>
            <li> Also identifies factors that affect DPR and factors that improve it
            <ul>
              <li> Cost and over-expectations of efficacy and doctor knowledge as main inhibitors </li>
              <li> Medical technology and service, communication, and publicized medical knowledge as main improvers </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Limited by reliance on convenience sampling and localization in China </li>
            <li> Questionnaire method did not allow for more in-depth exploration </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Phenomenological study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Hospital Clinic de Barcelona found that patients had “full confidence” in healthcare professionals; inhibitions to DPR such as business and uncertainty were perceived as “inevitable” rather than negative (Venturas et al., 2021)
            <ul>
              <li>Also identifies minimizing sense of isolation and allowing communication between patients and their families as key factors in patient satisfaction </li>
              <li>Participant group limited to inpatients hospitalized for COVID-19 in a single clinic in Barcelona </li>
              <li>Does not investigate long-term impacts</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Other studies regarding patient experience were also conducted in inpatient settings (Sarre et al., 2021), conducted in virtual telemedicine settings (Cliffe and Stevenson., 2021; Itamura et al., 2020), or were reiterative of the study conducted by Zhao et al (Hu, Lingmin et al., 2021). </li>
