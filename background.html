		  <h1>Background</h1><br><br>
		  <p>Cross-sectional study conducted through questionnaires in China found improvements in patients’ perception of the doctor-patient relationship (DPR) and increased trust as compared to before the pandemic (Zhao et al., 2021)
              <br> Also identifies factors that affect DPR and factors that improve it
                <br> Cost and over-expectations of efficacy and doctor knowledge as main inhibitors 
                <br> Medical technology and service, communication, and publicized medical knowledge as main improvers 
              <br><br> Limited by reliance on convenience sampling and localization in China
              <br><br> Questionnaire method did not allow for more in-depth exploration
            <br>Phenomenological study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Hospital Clinic de Barcelona found that patients had “full confidence” in healthcare professionals; inhibitions to DPR such as business and uncertainty were perceived as “inevitable” rather than negative (Venturas et al., 2021)
                <br>Also identifies minimizing sense of isolation and allowing communication between patients and their families as key factors in patient satisfaction 
                <br>Participant group limited to inpatients hospitalized for COVID-19 in a single clinic in Barcelona 
                <br>Does not investigate long-term impacts
            <br><br>Other studies regarding patient experience were also conducted in inpatient settings (Sarre et al., 2021), conducted in virtual telemedicine settings (Cliffe and Stevenson., 2021; Itamura et al., 2020), or were reiterative of the study conducted by Zhao et al (Hu, Lingmin et al., 2021).
