  <h1>Methods
  </h1><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Semi-structured virtual interview with photo elicitation (e.g. interview over Zoom)
      <ul>
        <li>Interviews will loosely follow an interview guide to lead discussions through a set of topics of interest (perceptions of DPR, trust, satisfaction). Subtopics are expected to appear emergently during interviews and will be explored as they do. </li>
        <li>The researcher will navigate through the clinical space being studied as if they were a patient and capture photos in the process. These photos will be elicited during </li>
        <li>Interviews will be transcribed verbatim. Transcripts will undergo three rounds of coding: open coding, selective coding, thematic analysis coding.</li>
        <li>Participants will be acquired through convenience sampling. Patients will be informed by a member of their healthcare team at the end of their visit of the study, its nature, its purpose, and measures to protect confidentiality and given the option to self-select if they wish to participate. Minors will be excluded.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Rationale
        <ul>
          <li>Interview conducted virtually to allow for a more comfortable environment while adhering to COVID-19 guidelines</li>
          <li>Interview is semi-structured because the overarching topic of discussion, patient experience, may be significantly subjective and dependent on each individual. A lack of complete structure will help minimize the introduction of preconceptions.</li>
          <li>Photo elicitation is used because there may be factors in the physical environment that influence perceptions of DPR</li>
          <li>The ordering and selection of coding methods are chosen to allow the data to be analyzed through the following process: identify what codes exist in the data, identify all data relevant to each code, determine how coded data speaks to the research questions. An inductive approach and thematic analysis suits the study because it is an exploration of subjective experience.</li>
          <li>The sampling method is chosen because it is the most feasible in a clinical setting. It is expected that most will decline to participate, so allowing any patient to self-select will help ensure that a participant group of adequate size is found. Presenting the study to patients through their healthcare team is ideal because it limits their interactions to people with whom they are already familiar, which is crucial in minimizing invasiveness in a setting wherein patients may feel particularly vulnerable.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li>Limitations
        <ul>
          <li>The interview method used is best suited for developing a general, initial understanding of the topic. This fits the nature of the study, but the lack of informed structure prevents deeper and/or more specific explorations of certain topics.</li>
          <li>The data collected and results generated will be qualitative in nature. It will uncover themes related to patient experience with respect to perceptions of DPR and its influences on trust and satisfaction, but will not provide accurate and representative results on things such as the degree of trust or the degree of success in DPR as a larger quantitative study would.</li>
          <li>The sampling method may lead to results that are not representative of the entire population of study. It may introduce motivation bias and fail to capture the experience of members of the population who are disabled or require translation. While the effects of biases can be uncovered and identified in the data analysis, some effects may remain hidden and all effects will still impact the results.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li>Measures to protect participants
        <ul>
          <li>Any and all identifying and medical information will be redacted from transcripts.</li>
          <li>Interviews will not probe for medical information. Participants may discuss it if they feel it is necessary to what they wish to convey, but this will be left to their discretion and redacted in the transcripts.</li>
          <li>All data will be stored in password-protected files belonging to the researcher. Passwords to the files and passwords to devices with the ability to access the files will only be known to the researcher. Recorded materials will be destroyed at the conclusion of the study.</li>
          <li>Prior to their entry into the study, participants will be informed of the nature of the study; its purpose; the methods used to collect, analyze, and protect their data; and that the researcher will have no knowledge of their medical information unless they disclose it. They will be given a written consent form and may revoke consent at any point through the study and through any method of their choosing.</li>
