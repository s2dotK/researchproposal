				<br><h1>Methods</h1>
      <h2>Structured Interview with Photo Elicitation</h2>
        <p>If approval is granted by the IRBs of the researcher’s overseeing institution and of OHSU, the researcher will present the research proposal in the form of a written document as well as a document for informed consent to administrative staff at OHSU Hospital and request permission to conduct research on the premises. If granted, close communication will be maintained to organize and coordinate participant recruitment and data collection. Over-the-phone healthcare interpreter services will be acquired from an organization certified by the Oregon Health Authority for use as needed.
					<br>Participants will be recruited through convenience sampling. Patients will be informed of the study at the beginning of their visit by a member of their healthcare team, who will present a document for informed consent provided by the researcher. The contents of this form are outlined below under “Measures to Protect Participants.” 
					<br>After acquiring signed consent from the participant or their legal guardian(s), interviews will be scheduled in conjunction with hospital staff to be conducted on-site in a private patient room in the presence of a member of the hospital’s administrative staff.
					<br>Interviews will loosely follow an interview guide to lead discussions through a set of topics of interest (perceptions of DPR, trust, satisfaction). Example starting questions include:
					<br><br>How do COVID protocols affect your experience here?
					<br>How would you describe your relationship with your doctor?
					<br>Has this changed after the pandemic hit? (If so, how? If not, why?)
					<br>Do these things affect your trust in your healthcare team? (If so, how and by how much? If not, why?)
					<br><br>Elucidating questions will also be included to encourage deeper discussion if needed. Examples include:
					<br><br>What is it like to interact with your doctor?
					<br>How do you feel during these interactions? 
					<br><br>Lastly, subtopics are expected to appear emergently during interviews and will be explored as they do.
					<br>The researcher will also request permission from administrative staff to navigate through the clinical space as if they were a patient and capture photos in the process. To avoid disruption and intrusion, the researcher will coordinate with hospital staff to accomplish this during times when patients are not present and staff are not using the space. Photos will be captured of the physical environment only, such as signage related to COVID-19 and evidence of social distancing protocol. If successful, these photos will be elicited during interviews to explore how aspects of the physical environment may influence perceptions of DPR.
					<br>The researcher will audio-record interviews and transcribe them verbatim by listening to the audio and typing what is heard into a private offline document on a single computer. Transcripts will undergo three rounds of coding: open coding, selective coding, thematic analysis coding.
				</p>
      <br><h2>Rationale</h2>
					<p>The interview will be conducted on-site in a patient room that provides privacy, to allow for a more comfortable environment, while adhering to COVID-19 guidelines. The presence of an administrative staff member helps ensure participants are not being mistreated. While the presence of a member of their healthcare team might help them feel safer, it may also pressure them to omit critique.
						<br>The structure provided by the interview guide ideally helps make participants more comfortable being interviewed, since they may be less comfortable with open discussion regarding aspects of their healthcare.
						<br>Photo elicitation is used because there may be factors in the physical environment that influence perceptions of DPR, such as how patients may feel they are being perceived or treated based on signage or how the pressure to follow COVID protocol may affect perceptions of DPR.
						<br>The ordering and selection of coding methods are chosen to allow the data to be analyzed through the following process: identify what codes exist in the data, identify all data relevant to each code, determine how coded data speaks to the research questions. An inductive approach and thematic analysis suit the study because it is an exploration of subjective experience.
						<br>The sampling method is chosen because it is the most feasible in a clinical setting. It is expected that the majority will decline to participate, so allowing any patient to self-select will help ensure that a participant group of adequate size is found. Presenting the study to patients through their healthcare team is ideal because it limits their interactions to people with whom they are already familiar, which is crucial in minimizing invasiveness in a setting wherein patients may feel particularly vulnerable.
					</p>
      <br><h2>Limitations</h2>
          <p>The broadness of the interview guide is suited for developing a general, initial understanding of the topic. The lack of focused specificity prevents deeper explorations of certain topics to an extent, but this does not invalidate the study since an initial understanding is the goal at this stage of exploration.
						<br>The data collected and the results generated will be qualitative in nature. Thus it will uncover themes related to patient experience with respect to perceptions of DPR and its influences on trust and satisfaction but will be less able to provide measures of degree and frequency than a quantitative study would. However, this is a minor limitation since qualitative descriptions of things such as trust and satisfaction arguably provide significantly more relevant meaning than quantitative measures.
						<br>The sampling method may lead to results that are not representative of the entire population. It may introduce motivation bias and fail to capture the experience of members of the population who are disabled and/or require translation. While the effects of biases can be uncovered and identified in the data analysis, some effects may remain hidden, and all effects will still impact the results. Still, this is likely the best option for research in clinical spaces conducted by a single researcher.
					</p>
      <br><h2>Measures to protect participants</h2>
          <p>The informed consent form will include all elements as required by the U.S. Code of Federal Relations, Title 45, Part 46, such as a description of the study, its methods, its purposes, its benefits, the measures that will be taken to protect privacy and confidentiality, the right to revoke consent and withdraw at any time, and relevant contact information. The form will also include an information sheet of the patients’ rights under HIPAA regulations, sourced from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
						<br>To protect the privacy and confidentiality of participants, any and all identifying and medical information will be redacted from transcripts. HIPAA regulations will be followed by the researcher as outlined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
						<br>Interviews will not probe for medical information. Participants may discuss it if they feel it is necessary to what they wish to convey, but this will be left to their discretion and redacted in the transcripts. Prior to their participation, participants will be notified that the researcher will have no knowledge of their medical information unless they disclose it.
						<br>All data will be stored in password-protected files belonging to the researcher. Passwords to the files and passwords to devices with the ability to access the files will only be known to the researcher. Recorded materials will be destroyed at the conclusion of the study.
