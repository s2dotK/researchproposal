    <h1>Rationale
    </h1><br>
    <ul>
      <li>The overarching question is how patient experience influences health outcomes. Understanding the patient experience is critical to the improvement of medicine due to the relationship between the patient experience and health outcomes. However, the question cannot be answered until the patient experience is sufficiently understood. This research will seek to elucidate current understandings of the patient experience.
      <ul>
        <li>A narrower question that contributes to the overarching is how patients perceive the doctor-patient relationship (DPR). The patient experience can be significantly influenced by patientsâ€™ experience of DPR, which can be directly influenced by medical professionals. Thus, relevant findings related to DPR can potentially be employed on a large scale for the widespread improvement of healthcare, making this a key point for investigation.</li>
        <li> Another point of investigation is trust and satisfaction. Trust and satisfaction play significant roles in health outcomes through psychological perceptions and the degree of adherence to treatment. DPR may influence trust and satisfaction in healthcare, making this the link between perceptions of DPR and health outcomes.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Hypothesis: Locally, perceptions of DPR remain more so positive than negative and trust and satisfaction remain moderately high, but both are significantly hampered by difficulties arising from the pandemic
        <ul>
          <li>Implications if true: It is essential to identify and address factors that inhibit DPR in order to improve trust and satisfaction by implementing improved standards for doctor-patient interaction</li>
          <li>Implications if DPR and trust/satisfaction do not show a strong correlation: In order to understand what contributes to trust and satisfaction, it is necessary to conduct a study that investigates additional influencing aspects of patient experience besides DPR</li>
          <li>Implications if both are very high: No immediate intervention is necessary</li>
          <li>Implications if both are very low: Widespread reform of clinical environment, protocol, and procedure is necessary</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
