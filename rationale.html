				<br><h1>Rationale</h1>
				<h2>Regarding the Research Topic</h2>
				<p>The overarching question is how patient experience influences health outcomes. Understanding the patient experience is critical to the improvement of medicine due to the relationship between the patient experience and health outcomes. However, the question cannot be answered until the patient experience is sufficiently understood. Due to the new cultural and clinical contexts brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is reasonable to expect that patient experience has changed in ways that may not have all been identified. This research will seek to elucidate current understandings of the patient experience. 
				<br>A narrower question that contributes to the overarching is how patients perceive the doctor-patient relationship (DPR). The patient experience can be significantly influenced by patients’ experience of DPR, which can be directly influenced by medical professionals. Thus, relevant findings related to DPR could be used on a large scale for the widespread improvement of healthcare, making this a key point for investigation. Another point of investigation is trust and satisfaction. 
				<br>Trust and satisfaction play significant roles in health outcomes through psychological perceptions and the degree of adherence to treatment. DPR may influence trust and satisfaction in healthcare, making this the link between perceptions of DPR and health outcomes.
				</p><br><h2>Regarding Site Selection</h2>
				<p>Outpatient clinical settings at OHSU are chosen as the sites of research because many of the previous studies on this topic were conducted in other countries and because those that were conducted in the United States were conducted in other clinical settings. Exploring the topic in outpatient settings is important because they account for the majority of clinical visits. Moreover, adherence to treatment is left mostly to the patient’s own discretion in outpatient settings. Since adherence to treatment is one of the main links between trust/satisfaction and health outcomes, it is critical to explore the topic in outpatient settings. Exploring the topic at OHSU Hospital is important because there remains little research on the topic in the United States. Due to region-based differences in cultural and clinical contexts, what existing literature has observed may differ from what may be observed here. Locally, restrictions are being lifted, but the new contexts created by the pandemic still remain. Thus, it is urgent to gain an understanding of the topic for the sake of healthcare quality, as in-person visits to the clinic return to higher levels.
				</p><br><h2>Hypothesis</h2>
				<p>It is hypothesized that perceptions of DPR remain more so positive and negative, that trust and satisfaction remain moderately high, and that both are hampered by difficulties arising from the pandemic.
					<br>If true, this implies that it is essential to identify and address factors that inhibit DPR in order to improve trust and satisfaction by implementing improved standards for doctor-patient interaction.
					<br>If DPR and trust/satisfaction do not show a strong correlation, it implies that to understand what contributes to trust and satisfaction, it may be necessary to conduct a study that investigates additional influencing aspects of patient experience besides DPR.
					<br>If both DPR and trust/satisfaction are very high, it implies that no urgent intervention is necessary for the quality of healthcare.
					<br>If both DPR and trust/satisfaction are very low, it implies that reform of clinical environment, protocol, and procedure may be necessary for the quality of healthcare.
