					<h1>Significance</h1><br><br>
						<p>The potential implications of this study are relevant to health outcomes and the quality of healthcare. Even if the hypothesis is disproven, a reevaluated understanding of the patient experience and its potential influences on health outcomes is essential in the new context created by the COVID-19 pandemic.
							<br>The study will contribute to a baseline of understanding of patient experience with respect to perceptions of DPR and influences on trust and satisfaction in outpatient settings, thus identifying opportunities for further research that would help improve healthcare.
							<br>Moreover, the study will explore the topic locally, whereas similar studies have explored it in the context of other countries. This is significant because differences in cultural and clinical contexts may change what is observed in studies of the same topic. This study not only enables observations that are more relevant locally but also allows potential differences to be revealed. Both are insights relevant to future research.
							<br>Lastly, the study will explore patient experience in outpatient settings, whereas others have explored it in an inpatient or virtual settings. If the results imply a need for changes in clinical environment, protocol, or procedure, they may be used by clinics and clinicians in preparation for the increase in outpatient visits as COVID-19 regulations are lifted.
