					<h1>Significance</h1><br><br>
				<p>Potential implications are highly relevant to the quality of healthcare<br>
          Even if hypothesis is disproven, a reevaluated understanding of the patient experience and its potential influences on health outcomes is essential in the new context created by the COVID-19 pandemic<br>
				<br><br>  
				Study will contribute to a baseline of understanding of patient experience with respect to perceptions of DPR and influences on trust and satisfaction in outpatient settings, thus identifying opportunities for further research that would help improve healthcare<br>
				Study will explore the topic locally, whereas similar studies have explored it in the geographic context of other countries<br>
				Study will explore patient experience in outpatient settings, whereas others have explored it in inpatient or virtual settings. Outpatient visits are more common than inpatient visits, and there will be a return to in-person visits after the pandemic. Thus, it is important to explore the topic in this context.</p>
